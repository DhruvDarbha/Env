# üé§ Siri Integration Setup for .env

## üìã Prerequisites

- **iOS 16.0+** required for App Intents
- **Physical iPhone** (Siri testing requires real device)
- **Xcode 14+** for iOS development
- **Apple Developer Account** for app signing

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Xcode Configuration

1. **Open the iOS project**:
   ```bash
   open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Add App Intents Framework**:
   - Select the Runner target
   - Go to Build Phases ‚Üí Link Binary With Libraries
   - Add `AppIntents.framework`

3. **Update deployment target**:
   - Set minimum iOS deployment target to 16.0
   - Update in both Runner target and Pods project

4. **Add Swift files to Xcode**:
   - Right-click Runner folder in Xcode
   - Add Files to Runner
   - Select:
     - `FruitAnalysisIntent.swift`
     - `SiriChannel.swift`
   - Ensure they're added to Runner target

### 2. Build and Test

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   flutter build ios --debug
   ```

2. **Run on physical device**:
   ```bash
   flutter run --debug
   ```

3. **Add Siri Shortcut**:
   - Open iPhone Settings
   - Go to Siri & Search
   - Tap "All Shortcuts"
   - Find ".env" section
   - Tap "Check Fruit Ripeness"
   - Record custom phrase or use suggested ones

### 3. Voice Commands

After setup, users can say:
- **"Hey Siri, check fruit ripeness with .env"**
- **"Hey Siri, ask .env to check if this fruit is ripe"**
- **"Hey Siri, analyze fruit with .env"**
- **"Hey Siri, check if my fruit is ripe using .env"**

## üéØ User Experience Flow

1. **Voice Activation**: User says Siri command
2. **App Launch**: .env opens automatically via deep link
3. **Camera Screen**: Siri analysis screen appears
4. **Instructions**: "Position your fruit in the frame"
5. **Countdown**: 5-second visual countdown with pulsing animation
6. **Auto Capture**: Photo taken automatically
7. **Analysis**: AI processing with loading indicator
8. **Results**: Ripeness analysis displayed with recommendations
9. **Actions**: Retake photo or return to home

## üîß Technical Components

### iOS Files Created:
- `FruitAnalysisIntent.swift` - App Intent definition
- `SiriChannel.swift` - Flutter-iOS communication bridge
- Updated `AppDelegate.swift` - Deep link handling
- Updated `Info.plist` - Permissions and URL schemes

### Flutter Files Created:
- `siri_service.dart` - Deep link handling service
- `siri_fruit_analysis_screen.dart` - Automatic camera workflow
- Updated `app.dart` - Added Siri route
- Updated `main.dart` - Initialize Siri service

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No shortcuts found"**:
   - Ensure iOS 16+ deployment target
   - Check App Intents framework is linked
   - Verify Swift files are added to target

2. **Deep link not working**:
   - Check URL scheme in Info.plist
   - Verify AppDelegate handles URLs correctly
   - Test deep link: `env://siri-fruit-analysis`

3. **Camera not initializing**:
   - Ensure camera permissions in Info.plist
   - Test on physical device (simulator camera is limited)
   - Check camera import statements

4. **Siri not recognizing app**:
   - Record shortcut in iOS Settings
   - Try different phrases
   - Ensure app is installed and launched once

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check iOS build errors
flutter clean
cd ios && pod install
flutter build ios --debug --verbose

# Test deep link manually
xcrun simctl openurl booted "env://siri-fruit-analysis"

# View iOS logs
flutter logs
```

## üì± Demo Script

1. **Setup**: "First, let me add the Siri shortcut..."
2. **Activation**: "Hey Siri, ask .env to check if this fruit is ripe"
3. **Demo**: Show automatic camera, countdown, capture, and analysis
4. **Results**: Highlight ripeness score, shelf life, and recommendations

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Multiple fruit detection**: Analyze multiple fruits in one photo
- **Voice feedback**: Siri reads analysis results aloud
- **Smart suggestions**: Based on previous analyses
- **Batch processing**: Analyze entire fruit bowl
- **Shopping integration**: Add to grocery list based on analysis
