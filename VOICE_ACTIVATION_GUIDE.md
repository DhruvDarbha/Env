## 🔧 Setup and Configuration

### Dependencies Added
```yaml
dependencies:
  speech_to_text: ^6.6.0      # Speech recognition
  flutter_tts: ^3.8.5         # Text-to-speech
  permission_handler: ^11.1.0  # Microphone permissions
```

### Permissions Required

#### Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

#### iOS (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`)
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access for voice commands</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs speech recognition for voice commands</string>
```

### Provider Integration
The voice system is integrated into your app's state management:

```dart
// In main.dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => VoiceProvider()),
    // ... other providers
  ],
)
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Navigation
```
User: "Go to consumer dashboard"
App: "Executing: Go to consumer dashboard"
→ Navigates to consumer dashboard
```

### Food Bank Search
```
User: "Find food banks near me"
App: "Searching for food banks near your current location"
→ Triggers location-based search
```

### Help System
```
User: "Help"
App: Shows dialog with available commands
    "Showing available voice commands..."
```

## 🔍 Testing
